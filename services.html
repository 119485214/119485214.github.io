   <p> <b>HyperAutomation</b>  </p>
     
      <p> As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and 
	  <p>augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated,
      <p>but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation
	  technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities.</p> 

        <p>How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?

        When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. 

        <p> It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and run efficiently 
		<p>with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making. </p>

   <p> <b>Multiexperience</b>  </p>
     
      <p> For the past decade of modern mobility (since the introduction of iOS and Android in 2007), enterprises have worked in parallel to transform web development for responsive,multichannel support and
	  <p>to ramp up mobile app development competencies. Over that time, technologies and practices have matured and converged, 
	  <p>such as the common use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and RESTful APIs, along with the adoption of agile methodologies and DevOps.</p>
	 <p> Now the time has come to consider the merging of web and mobile development activities as “business as usual” for development organizations, and extend this to the next generation of user experiences</p>
    <p>Application leaders must adopt an appropriate multiexperience development platform to create and support a plethora of digital user experiences. 
    <p>A MXDP offers professional and citizen developers a range of front-end development tools and back-end services that enable rapid, scalable development of seamless, targeted and ambient user experiences
	across devices and channels.Gartner recently published a “Tech Insight for Multiexperience Development Platforms” research note to introduce this concept to our clients.  We encourage client inquiries with
 the authors of this research to learn more.

   <p> <b>Distributed cloud </b>  </p>
     
      <p> A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. 
	 <p> Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and
	<p> opportunities for increased security. 
	 <p> Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. A distributed cloud also processes data in real-time.</P>
      <p>Edge computing is already a reality. It’s anticipated that a significant increase in connected technology will surge the demand for edge computing to alleviate network traffic. 
	  <p>One major contributor to its growth is the Internet of Things (IoT). Santhosh Rao, Gartner’s senior analyst, commented that “currently, around 10 percent of enterprise-generated data is
      <p> created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud.
	  <p>By 2025, Gartner predicts this figure will reach 75 percent.”
